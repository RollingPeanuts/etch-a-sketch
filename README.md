# Etch-a-Sketch
A web implementation of a etch-a-sketch and sketchpad hybrid. It features the ability to change colors as well as different "pens" that can mixed in a single drawing. The pens include a brush, which allows you to layer strokes over the same space to cause the hue to darken, a reversible pen, which fills in spaces that are uncolored and erases spaces that are colored, and a color changing pen, which randomly changes color while drawing. It also features an adjustable grid to allow you to customize the fineness of the drawing. Future developments will work to adjust the grid automatically depending on screen size as well as add further pen modes and grid customization.
